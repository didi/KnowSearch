/**
 * A field mapper that supports lookup of dynamic sub-keys. If the field mapper is named 'my_field',
 * then a user is able to search on the field in both of the following ways:
 * - Using the field name 'my_field', which will delegate to the field type
 *   {@link DynamicKeyFieldMapper#fieldType()} as usual.
 * - Using any sub-key, for example 'my_field.some_key'. In this case, the search is delegated
 *   to {@link DynamicKeyFieldMapper#keyedFieldType(String)}, with 'some_key' passed as the
 *   argument. The field mapper is allowed to create a new field type dynamically in order
 *   to handle the search.
 *
 * To prevent conflicts between these dynamic sub-keys and multi-fields, any field mappers
 * implementing this interface should explicitly disallow multi-fields. The constructor makes
 * sure to passes an empty multi-fields list to help prevent conflicting sub-keys from being
 * registered.
 *
 * Note: we anticipate that 'flattened' fields will be the only implementation of this
 * interface. Flattened object fields live in the 'mapper-flattened' module.
