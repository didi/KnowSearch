=== Always condition

Use the `always` condition to set the condition to `true`. This forces the watch 
actions to be executed unless they are <<actions-ack-throttle,throttled>>. 

The `always` condition enables you to perform watch actions on a fixed schedule, 
such as, _"Every Friday at noon, send a status report email to 
sys.admin@example.com."_

==== Using the always condition

This is the default if you omit the condition definition from a watch.

There are no attributes to specify for the `always` condition. To explicitly 
use this condition, specify the condition type and associate it with an empty 
object:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
"condition" : {
  "always" : {}
}
