=== Never condition

Use the `never` condition to set the condition to `false`. This means the
watch actions are never executed when the watch is triggered. The watch input is
executed, a record is added to the watch history, and the watch execution ends.
This condition is generally used for testing.

==== Using the never condition

There are no attributes to specify for the `never` condition. To use the it,
you specify the condition type and associate it with an empty object:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
"condition" : {
  "never" : {}
}
