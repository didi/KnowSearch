=== Context examples

To run the examples, index the sample seat data into Elasticsearch. The examples
must be run sequentially to work correctly.

. Download the
https://download.elastic.co/demos/painless/contexts/seats.json[seat data]. This
data set contains booking information for a collection of plays. Each document
represents a single seat for a play at a particular theater on a specific date
and time.
+
Each document contains the following fields:
+
`theatre` ({ref}/keyword.html[`keyword`])::
        The name of the theater the play is in.
`play` ({ref}/text.html[`text`])::
        The name of the play.
`actors` ({ref}/text.html[`text`])::
        A list of actors in the play.
`row` ({ref}/number.html[`integer`])::
        The row of the seat.
`number` ({ref}/number.html[`integer`])::
        The number of the seat within a row.
`cost` ({ref}/number.html[`double`])::
        The cost of the ticket for the seat.
`sold` ({ref}/boolean.html[`boolean`])::
        Whether or not the seat is sold.
`datetime` ({ref}/date.html[`date`])::
        The date and time of the play as a date object.
`date` ({ref}/keyword.html[`keyword`])::
        The date of the play as a keyword.
`time` ({ref}/keyword.html[`keyword`])::
        The time of the play as a keyword.

. {defguide}/running-elasticsearch.html[Start] Elasticsearch. Note these
examples assume Elasticsearch and Kibana are running locally. To use the Console
editor with a remote Kibana instance, click the settings icon and enter the
Console URL. To submit a cURL request to a remote Elasticsearch instance, edit
the request URL.

. Create {ref}/mapping.html[mappings] for the sample data:
+
[source,console]
----
PUT /seats
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "theatre":  { "type": "keyword" },
      "play":     { "type": "keyword" },
      "actors":   { "type": "text"    },
      "row":      { "type": "integer" },
      "number":   { "type": "integer" },
      "cost":     { "type": "double"  },
      "sold":     { "type": "boolean" },
      "datetime": { "type": "date"    },
      "date":     { "type": "keyword" },
      "time":     { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}

. Run the <<painless-ingest-processor-context, ingest processor context>>
example. This sets up a script ingest processor used on each document as the
seat data is indexed.

. Index the seat data:
+
[source,js]
----
curl -XPOST "localhost:9200/seats/_bulk?pipeline=seats" -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" --data-binary "@/<local-file-path>/seats.json"
