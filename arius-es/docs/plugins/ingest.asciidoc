== Ingest Plugins

The ingest plugins extend Elasticsearch by providing additional ingest node capabilities.

=== Core Ingest Plugins

The core ingest plugins are:

<<ingest-attachment>>::

The ingest attachment plugin lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF) by
using the Apache text extraction library http://lucene.apache.org/tika/[Tika].

<<ingest-geoip>>::

The `geoip` processor adds information about the geographical location of IP
addresses, based on data from the Maxmind databases. This processor adds this
information by default under the `geoip` field. The `geoip` processor is no
longer distributed as a plugin, but is now a module distributed by default with
Elasticsearch. See {ref}/geoip-processor.html[GeoIP processor] for more
details.

<<ingest-user-agent>>::

A processor that extracts details from the User-Agent header value. The
`user_agent` processor is no longer distributed as a plugin, but is now a module
distributed by default with Elasticsearch. See
{ref}/user-agent-processor.html[User Agent processor] for more details.
