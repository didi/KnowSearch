== Query DSL

Elasticsearch provides a full Java query dsl in a similar manner to the
REST {ref}/query-dsl.html[Query DSL]. The factory for query
builders is `QueryBuilders`. Once your query is ready, you can use the
<<java-search,Search API>>.

To use `QueryBuilders` just import them in your class:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
import static org.elasticsearch.index.query.QueryBuilders.*;
--------------------------------------------------

Note that you can easily print (aka debug) JSON generated queries using
`toString()` method on `QueryBuilder` object.

The `QueryBuilder` can then be used with any API that accepts a query,
such as `count` and `search`.
