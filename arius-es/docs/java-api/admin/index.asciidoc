== Java API Administration

Elasticsearch provides a full Java API to deal with administration tasks.

To access them, you need to call `admin()` method from a client to get an `AdminClient`:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
AdminClient adminClient = client.admin();
--------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
In the rest of this guide, we will use `client.admin()`.
