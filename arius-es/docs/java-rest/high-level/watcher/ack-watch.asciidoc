=== Ack watch API

[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Execution

{ref}/actions.html#actions-ack-throttle[Acknowledging a watch] enables you
to manually throttle execution of a watch's actions. A watch can be acknowledged
through the following request:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The ID of the watch to ack.
<2> An optional list of IDs representing the watch actions that should be acked.
If no action IDs are provided, then all of the watch's actions will be acked.

[id="{upid}-{api}-response"]
==== Response

The returned +{response}+ contains the new status of the requested watch:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The status of a specific action that was acked.
<2> The acknowledgement state of the action. If the action was successfully
acked, this state will be equal to `AckStatus.State.ACKED`.
