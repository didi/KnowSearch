=== Set Upgrade Mode API

The Set Upgrade Mode API temporarily halts all {ml} job and {dfeed} tasks when `enabled=true`. Their
reported states remain unchanged. Consequently, when exiting upgrade mode the halted {ml} jobs and
{dfeeds} will return to their previous state.

It accepts a +{request}+ object and responds with a +{response}+ object.

When `enabled=true`, no new jobs can be opened, and no job or {dfeed} tasks will
be running. Be sure to set `enabled=false` once upgrade actions are completed.
