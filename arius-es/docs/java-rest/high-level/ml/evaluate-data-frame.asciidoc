=== Evaluate {dfanalytics} API

Evaluates the {ml} algorithm that ran on a {dataframe}.
The API accepts an +{request}+ object and returns an +{response}+.

--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Constructing a new evaluation request
<2> Reference to an existing index
<3> The query with which to select data from indices
<4> Evaluation to be performed

==== Evaluation

Evaluation to be performed.
Currently, supported evaluations include: +BinarySoftClassification+, +Classification+, +Regression+.

<2> Name of the field in the index. Its value denotes the actual (i.e. ground truth) label for an example. Must be either true or false.
<3> Name of the field in the index. Its value denotes the probability (as per some ML algorithm) of the example being classified as positive.
<4> The remaining parameters are the metrics to be calculated based on the two fields described above
