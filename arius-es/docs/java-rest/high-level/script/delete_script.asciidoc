=== Delete Stored Script API

[[java-rest-high-delete-stored-script-request]]
==== Delete Stored Script Request

A `DeleteStoredScriptRequest` requires an `id`:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/StoredScriptsDocumentationIT.java[delete-stored-script-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The id of the script

==== Optional arguments
The following arguments can optionally be provided:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/StoredScriptsDocumentationIT.java[delete-stored-script-request-timeout]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timeout to wait for the all the nodes to acknowledge the stored script is deleted as a `TimeValue`
<2> Timeout to wait for the all the nodes to acknowledge the stored script is deleted as a `String`

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/StoredScriptsDocumentationIT.java[delete-stored-script-request-masterTimeout]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `TimeValue`
<2> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `String`

[[java-rest-high-delete-stored-script-sync]]
==== Synchronous Execution
["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/StoredScriptsDocumentationIT.java[delete-stored-script-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-delete-stored-script-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous execution of a delete stored script request requires both the `DeleteStoredScriptRequest`
instance and an `ActionListener` instance to be passed to the asynchronous method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/StoredScriptsDocumentationIT.java[delete-stored-script-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `DeleteStoredScriptRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

[[java-rest-high-delete-stored-script-listener]]
===== Action Listener

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `DeleteStoredScriptResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/StoredScriptsDocumentationIT.java[delete-stored-script-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[[java-rest-high-delete-stored-script-response]]
==== Delete Stored Script Response

The returned `DeleteStoredScriptResponse` allows to retrieve information about the
executed operation as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/StoredScriptsDocumentationIT.java[delete-stored-script-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Indicates whether all of the nodes have acknowledged the request
