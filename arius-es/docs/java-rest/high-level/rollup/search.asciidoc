=== Rollup Search API

The Rollup Search endpoint allows searching rolled-up data using the standard
query DSL. The Rollup Search endpoint is needed because, internally,
rolled-up documents utilize a different document structure than the original
data. The Rollup Search endpoint rewrites standard query DSL into a format that
matches the rollup documents, then takes the response and rewrites it back to
what a client would expect given the original query.

[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Request

Rollup Search uses the same +{request}+ that is used by the <<{mainid}-search>>
but it is mostly for aggregations you should set the `size` to 0 and add
aggregations like this:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request]
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE:: Rollup Search is limited in many ways because only some query elements
can be translated into queries against the rollup indices. See the main
{ref}/rollup-search.html[Rollup Search] documentation for more.

include::../execution.asciidoc[]

[id="{upid}-{api}-response"]
==== Response

Rollup Search returns the same +{response}+ that is used by the
<<{mainid}-search>> and everything can be accessed in exactly the same way.
This will access the aggregation built by the example request above:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-response]
--------------------------------------------------
