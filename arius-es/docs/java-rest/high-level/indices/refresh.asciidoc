=== Refresh API

[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Refresh Request

A +{request}+ can be applied to one or more indices, or even on `_all` the indices:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Refresh one index
<2> Refresh multiple indices
<3> Refresh all the indices

==== Optional arguments

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request-indicesOptions]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Setting `IndicesOptions` controls how unavailable indices are resolved and
how wildcard expressions are expanded

include::../execution.asciidoc[]

[id="{upid}-{api}-response"]
==== Refresh Response

The returned +{response}+ allows to retrieve information about the
executed operation as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Total number of shards hit by the refresh request
<2> Number of shards where the refresh has succeeded
<3> Number of shards where the refresh has failed
<4> A list of failures if the operation failed on one or more shards

By default, if the indices were not found, an `ElasticsearchException` will be thrown:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-notfound]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Do something if the indices to be refreshed were not found
