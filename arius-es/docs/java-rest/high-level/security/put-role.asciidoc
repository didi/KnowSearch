==== Put Role Request

The +{request}+ class is used to create or update a role in the Native Roles
Store. The request contains a single role, which encapsulates privileges over
resources. A role can be assigned to an user using the
<<{upid}-put-role-mapping, Put Role Mapping API>>.

The returned +{response}+ contains a single field, `created`. This field

updated.
