=== Rank features datatype

<titleabbrev>Rank features</titleabbrev>

A `rank_features` field can index numeric feature vectors, so that they can
later be used to boost documents in queries with a
<<query-dsl-rank-feature-query,`rank_feature`>> query.

It is analogous to the <<rank-feature,`rank_feature`>> datatype but is better suited
when the list of features is sparse so that it wouldn't be reasonable to add
one field to the mappings for each of them.

<1> Rank features fields must use the `rank_features` field type
<2> Rank features fields must be a hash with string keys and strictly positive numeric values

NOTE: `rank_features` fields only support single-valued features and strictly
positive values. Multi-valued fields and zero or negative values will be rejected.

NOTE: `rank_features` fields do not support sorting or aggregating and may
only be queried using <<query-dsl-rank-feature-query,`rank_feature`>> queries.

NOTE: `rank_features` fields only preserve 9 significant bits for the
precision, which translates to a relative error of about 0.4%.
