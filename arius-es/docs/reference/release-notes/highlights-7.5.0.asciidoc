==== {ml-cap} {classanalysis}

{ml-docs}/dfa-classification.html[{classanalysis-cap}] is a supervised {ml}
process for predicting a class or category of a given data point in a dataset.
For example, it can determine whether an email is spam or not.
{classification-cap} is for predicting discrete, categorical values, unlike
{reganalysis}, which predicts continuous, numerical values. 7.5.0 introduces
binary classification, which can label data points into two possible categories.
