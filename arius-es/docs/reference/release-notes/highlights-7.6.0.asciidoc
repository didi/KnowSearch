==== New histogram field type

A new {ref}/histogram.html[histogram field type] has been added. The new `histogram` field accepts
pre-aggregated histograms which can later be used directly in the
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.html[percentiles] and
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-rank-aggregation.html[percentile_ranks] aggregations.
This allows users to pre-aggregate histogram data locally and only send the final
data structure, saving storage and network bandwidth while retaining the ability to
aggregate it like any other data.

==== Optimized sorting on long field types

Sorting on a {ref}/number.html[`long`] field now internally rewrites into a Lucene `DistanceFeatureQuery`.
This lets {es} skip non-competitive hits, which often improves query speed.
In benchmarking tests, this sped up sorts on `long` fields by 10x.
