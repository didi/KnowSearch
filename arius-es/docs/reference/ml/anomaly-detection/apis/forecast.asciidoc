[[ml-forecast-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`duration`::
  (Optional, <<time-units, time units>>) A period of time that indicates how far 
  into the future to forecast. For example, `30d` corresponds to 30 days. The 
  default value is 1 day. The forecast starts at the last record that was 
  processed.

  If set to a value of `0`, the forecast is never automatically deleted.
