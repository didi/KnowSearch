[[ccr-settings]]
=== {ccr-cap} settings

These {ccr} settings can be dynamically updated on a live cluster with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings API>>.

[float]
[[ccr-recovery-settings]]
==== Remote recovery settings

The following setting can be used to rate-limit the data transmitted during
<<remote-recovery,remote recoveries>>:

`ccr.indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` (<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>)::
Limits the total inbound and outbound remote recovery traffic on each node.
Since this limit applies on each node, but there may be many nodes performing
remote recoveries concurrently, the total amount of remote recovery bytes may be
much higher than this limit. If you set this limit too high then there is a risk
that ongoing remote recoveries will consume an excess of bandwidth (or other
resources) which could destabilize the cluster. This setting is used by both the
leader and follower clusters. For example if it is set to `20mb` on a leader,
the leader will only send `20mb/s` to the follower even if the follower is
requesting and can accept `60mb/s`. Defaults to `40mb`.

[[ccr-advanced-recovery-settings]]
==== Advanced remote recovery settings

The following _expert_ settings can be set to manage the resources consumed by
remote recoveries:

`ccr.indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunks` (<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>)::
Controls the number of file chunk requests that can be sent in parallel per
recovery. As multiple remote recoveries might already running in parallel,
increasing this expert-level setting might only help in situations where remote
recovery of a single shard is not reaching the total inbound and outbound remote recovery traffic as configured by `ccr.indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec`.
Defaults to `5`. The maximum allowed value is `10`.

`ccr.indices.recovery.chunk_size`(<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>)::
Controls the chunk size requested by the follower during file transfer. Defaults to
`1mb`.

`ccr.indices.recovery.recovery_activity_timeout`(<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>)::
Controls the timeout for recovery activity. This timeout primarily applies on
the leader cluster. The leader cluster must open resources in-memory to supply
data to the follower during the recovery process. If the leader does not receive recovery requests from the follower for this period of time, it will close the resources. Defaults to 60 seconds.

`ccr.indices.recovery.internal_action_timeout` (<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>)::
Controls the timeout for individual network requests during the remote recovery
process. An individual action timing out can fail the recovery. Defaults to
60 seconds.
