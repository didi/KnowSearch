=== {ilm-cap} settings

These are the settings available for configuring Index Lifecycle Management

==== Cluster level settings

`xpack.ilm.enabled`::
Whether ILM is enabled or disabled, setting this to `false` disables any
ILM REST API endpoints and functionality. Defaults to `true`.

`indices.lifecycle.poll_interval`::
(<<time-units, time units>>) How often {ilm} checks for indices that meet policy
criteria. Defaults to `10m`.

`indices.lifecycle.history_index_enabled`::
Whether ILM's history index is enabled. If enabled, ILM will record the
history of actions taken as part of ILM policies to the `ilm-history-*`
indices. Defaults to `true`.

==== Index level settings
These index-level {ilm-init} settings are typically configured through index
templates. For more information, see <<ilm-gs-create-policy>>.

`index.lifecycle.name`::
The name of the policy to use to manage the index.

`index.lifecycle.rollover_alias`::
The index alias to update when the index rolls over. Specify when using a
policy that contains a rollover action. When the index rolls over, the alias is
updated to reflect that the index is no longer the write index. For more
information about rollover, see <<using-policies-rollover>>.

`index.lifecycle.parse_origination_date`::
When configured to `true` the origination date will be parsed from the index
name. The index format must match the pattern `^.*-{date_format}-\\d+`, where
the `date_format` is `yyyy.MM.dd` and the trailing digits are optional (an
index that was rolled over would normally match the full format eg.
`logs-2016.10.31-000002`). If the index name doesn't match the pattern
the index creation will fail.

`index.lifecycle.origination_date`::
The timestamp that will be used to calculate the index age for its phase
transitions. This allows the users to create an index containing old data and
use the original creation date of the old data to calculate the index age.
