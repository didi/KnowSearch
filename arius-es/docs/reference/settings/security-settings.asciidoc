[[security-settings]]
=== Security settings in {es}
++++
<titleabbrev>Security settings</titleabbrev>
++++

By default, the {es} {security-features} are disabled when you have a basic or
trial license. To enable {security-features}, use the `xpack.security.enabled`
setting.

You configure `xpack.security` settings  to
<<anonymous-access-settings, enable anonymous access>>
and perform message authentication,
<<field-document-security-settings, set up document and field level security>>,
<<realm-settings, configure realms>>,
<<ssl-tls-settings, encrypt communications with SSL>>, and
<<auditing-settings, audit security events>>.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file,
with the exception of the secure settings, which you add to the {es} keystore.
For more information about creating and updating the {es} keystore, see
<<secure-settings>>.

[float]
[[general-security-settings]]
==== General security settings
`xpack.security.enabled`::
Set to `true` to enable {es} {security-features} on the node. +
+
--
If set to `false`, which is the default value for basic and trial licenses,
{security-features} are disabled. It also affects all {kib} instances that
connect to this {es} instance; you do not need to disable {security-features} in
those `kibana.yml` files. For more information about disabling {security-features}
in specific {kib} instances, see
{kibana-ref}/security-settings-kb.html[{kib} security settings].

TIP: If you have gold or higher licenses, the default value is `true`; we 
recommend that you explicitly add this setting to avoid confusion.  

--

`xpack.security.hide_settings`::
A comma-separated list of settings that are omitted from the results of the
<<cluster-nodes-info,cluster nodes info API>>. You can use wildcards to include
multiple settings in the list.  For example, the following value hides all the
settings for the ad1 active_directory realm:
`xpack.security.authc.realms.active_directory.ad1.*`.
The API already omits all `ssl` settings, `bind_dn`, and `bind_password` due to
the sensitive nature of the information.

`xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled`::
Enables fips mode of operation. Set this to `true` if you run this {es} instance in a FIPS 140-2 enabled JVM.  For more information, see <<fips-140-compliance>>. Defaults to `false`.

[float]
[[password-hashing-settings]]
==== Password hashing settings
`xpack.security.authc.password_hashing.algorithm`::
Specifies the hashing algorithm that is used for secure user credential storage. 
See <<password-hashing-algorithms>>. Defaults to `bcrypt`.

[float]
[[anonymous-access-settings]]
==== Anonymous access settings
You can configure the following anonymous access settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`.  For more information, see <<anonymous-access>>.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.username`::
The username (principal) of the anonymous user. Defaults to `_es_anonymous_user`.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.roles`::
The roles to associate with the anonymous user. Required.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.authz_exception`::
When `true`, an HTTP 403 response is returned if the anonymous user
does not have the appropriate permissions for the requested action. The
user is not prompted to provide credentials to access the requested
resource. When set to `false`, an HTTP 401 response is returned and the user
can provide credentials with the appropriate permissions to gain
access. Defaults to `true`.

[float]
[[security-automata-settings]]
==== Automata Settings
In places where the {security-features} accept wildcard patterns (e.g. index
patterns in roles, group matches in the role mapping API), each pattern is
compiled into an Automaton. The follow settings are available to control this
behaviour.

`xpack.security.automata.max_determinized_states`::
The upper limit on how many automaton states may be created by a single pattern.
This protects against too-difficult (e.g. exponentially hard) patterns.
Defaults to `100,000`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.enabled`::
Whether to cache the compiled automata. Compiling automata can be CPU intensive
and may slowdown some operations. The cache reduces the frequency with which
automata need to be compiled.
Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.size`::
The maximum number of items to retain in the automata cache.
Defaults to `10,000`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.ttl`::

recent usage).
Defaults to `48h` (48 hours).

[float]
[[field-document-security-settings]]
==== Document and field level security settings

You can set the following document and field level security
settings in `elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see
<<field-and-document-access-control>>.

from being configured. Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.ttl`::
The time-to-live for cached `BitSet` entries for document level security.
Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are
automatically cached to improve performance. Defaults to expire entries that are
unused for `168h` (7 days).

`xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.size`::
The maximum memory usage of cached `BitSet` entries for document level security.
Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are
automatically cached to improve performance. Defaults to `50mb`, after which 
least-recently-used entries will be evicted.

[float]
[[token-service-settings]]
==== Token service settings

You can set the following token service settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`.

`xpack.security.authc.token.enabled`::
Set to `false` to disable the built-in token service. Defaults to `true` unless
 `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is `false`. This prevents sniffing the token
  from a connection over plain http.

`xpack.security.authc.token.timeout`::

this setting is not valid. For more information on
the different modes, see <<ldap-realm>>.

`authorization_realms`::
The names of the realms that should be consulted for delegated authorization.
If this setting is used, then the LDAP realm does not perform role mapping and
instead loads the user from the listed realms. The referenced realms are
consulted in the order that they are defined in this list.

[[load-balancing]]
===== Load balancing and failover

The `load_balance.type` setting can have the following values: 

* `failover`: The URLs specified are used in the order that they are specified. 
The first server that can be connected to will be used for all subsequent 
connections. If a connection to that server fails then the next server that a 
connection can be established to will be used for subsequent connections.
* `dns_failover`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be specified.
This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all IP 
addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections to the Active Directory 
or LDAP server will always be tried in the order in which they were retrieved. 
This differs from `failover` in that there is no reordering of the list and if a 
server has failed at the beginning of the list, it will still be tried for each 
subsequent connection.
* `round_robin`: Connections will continuously iterate through the list of 
provided URLs. If a server is unavailable, iterating through the list of URLs 
will continue until a successful connection is made.
* `dns_round_robin`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be 
specified. This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all 
IP addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections will continuously 
iterate through the list of addresses. If a server is unavailable, iterating 
through the list of URLs will continue until a successful connection is made.

[[ssl-tls-settings]]
==== General TLS settings
`xpack.security.ssl.diagnose.trust`::
Controls whether to output diagnostic messages for SSL/TLS trust failures.
If this is `true` (the default), a message will be printed to the Elasticsearch
log whenever an SSL connection (incoming or outgoing) is rejected due to a failure
to establish trust.
This diagnostic message contains information that can be used to determine the
cause of the failure and assist with resolving the problem.
Set to `false` to disable these messages.
NOTE: This defaults to `false` when `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled` is `true`.

==== Default values for TLS/SSL settings
In general, the values below represent the default values for the various TLS
settings.
The prefixes for these settings are based on the context in which they are
used (e.g. `xpack.security.authc.realms.ldap.corp_ldap.ssl.verification_mode`
or `xpack.security.transport.ssl.supported_protocols`).

For more information, see
<<encrypting-communications>>.

`*.ssl.supported_protocols`::
Supported protocols with versions. Valid protocols: `SSLv2Hello`,
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.3`. Defaults to `TLSv1.3,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1` if
the JVM supports TLSv1.3, otherwise `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1`.
+
--
NOTE: If `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled` is `true`, you cannot use `SSLv2Hello` 
or `SSLv3`. See <<fips-140-compliance>>.
--

`*.ssl.client_authentication`::
Controls the server's behavior in regard to requesting a certificate
from client connections. Valid values are `required`, `optional`, and `none`.
`required` forces a client to present a certificate, while `optional`
requests a client certificate but the client is not required to present one.
Defaults to `required`, except for HTTP, which defaults to `none`. See
 <<http-tls-ssl-settings>>.

`*.ssl.verification_mode`::
Controls the verification of certificates. Valid values are:
- `full`, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
       authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP
       address) matches the names identified within the certificate.
- `certificate`, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a
       trusted authority (CA), but does not perform any hostname verification.
- `none`, which performs _no verification_ of the server's certificate. This mode
       disables many of the security benefits of SSL/TLS and should only be
       used after very careful consideration. It is primarily intended as a
       temporary diagnostic mechanism when attempting to resolve TLS errors,
       and its use on production clusters is strongly discouraged.
+
The default value is `full`.

`*.ssl.cipher_suites`::
Supported cipher suites can be found in Oracle's
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-7093246A-31A3-4304-AC5F-5FB6400405E2[Java
 Cryptography Architecture documentation].
Defaults to `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`,
`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`,
`TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
`TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`.
+
--
NOTE: The default cipher suites list above includes TLSv1.3 ciphers and ciphers
that require the _Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
Jurisdiction Policy Files_ for 256-bit AES encryption. If TLSv1.3 is not
available, the TLSv1.3 ciphers TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
will not be included in the default list. If 256-bit AES is unavailable, ciphers
with `AES_256` in their names wil not be included in the default list. Finally,
AES GCM has known performance issues in Java versions prior to 11 and will only
be included in the default list when using Java 11 or above.

[[tls-ssl-key-settings]]
===== TLS/SSL key and trusted certificate settings

The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the
trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS
connection. If no trusted certificates are configured, the default certificates
that are trusted by the JVM will be trusted along with the certificate(s)
associated with a key in the same context. The key and certificate must be in
place for connections that require client authentication or when acting as a
SSL enabled server.

[[pkcs12-truststore-note]]
[NOTE]
Storing trusted certificates in a PKCS#12 file, although supported, is
uncommon in practice. The <<certutil,`elasticsearch-certutil` tool>>,
as well as Java's `keytool`, are designed to generate PKCS#12 files that
can be used both as a keystore and as a truststore, but this may not be the
case for container files that are created using other tools. Usually,
PKCS#12 files only contain secret and private entries. To confirm that
a PKCS#12 container includes trusted certificate ("anchor") entries look for
`2.16.840.1.113894.746875.1.1: <Unsupported tag 6>` in the
`openssl pkcs12 -info` output, or `trustedCertEntry` in the
`keytool -list` output.

[float]
===== Transport profile TLS/SSL settings
The same settings that are available for the <<transport-tls-ssl-settings, default transport>>
are also available for each transport profile. By default, the settings for a
transport profile will be the same as the default transport unless they
are specified.

As an example, lets look at the key setting. For the default transport
this is `xpack.security.transport.ssl.key`. In order to use this setting in a
transport profile, use the prefix `transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.` and
append the portion of the setting after `xpack.security.transport.`. For the key
setting, this would be `transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.ssl.key`.
