Snapshot stats details are provided in a new structured way:

* `total` section for all the files that are referenced by the snapshot.
* `incremental` section for those files that actually needed to be copied over as part of the incremental snapshotting.
* In case of a snapshot that's still in progress, there's also a `processed` section for files that are in the process of being copied.
