=== Discovery changes

[float]
==== Only a single port may be given for each seed host.

In earlier versions you could include a range of ports in entries in the
`discovery.seed_hosts` list, but {es} used only the first port in the range and
unexpectedly ignored the rest.  For instance if you set `discovery.seed_hosts:
"10.11.12.13:9300-9310"` then {es} would only use `10.11.12.13:9300` for
discovery. Seed host addresses containing port ranges are now rejected.
