If you temporarily halted the tasks associated with your {ml} jobs,
use the <<ml-set-upgrade-mode,set upgrade mode API>> to return them to active
states:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/set_upgrade_mode?enabled=false
--------------------------------------------------

If you closed all {ml} jobs before the upgrade, open the jobs and start the
datafeeds from {kib} or with the <<ml-open-job,open jobs>> and
<<ml-start-datafeed,start datafeed>> APIs.
