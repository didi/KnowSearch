Take us out of upgrade mode after running any snippets on this page.

If your {ml} indices were created before {prev-major-version}, you must
<<reindex-upgrade,reindex the indices>>.

If your {ml} indices were created in {prev-major-version}, you can:

* Leave your {ml} jobs running during the upgrade. When you shut down a
{ml} node, its jobs automatically move to another node and restore the model
states. This option enables your jobs to continue running during the upgrade but
it puts increased load on the cluster.

* Temporarily halt the tasks associated with your {ml} jobs and {dfeeds} and
prevent new jobs from opening by using the
<<ml-set-upgrade-mode,set upgrade mode API>>:
+
[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/set_upgrade_mode?enabled=true
--------------------------------------------------

When you disable upgrade mode, the jobs resume using the last model
state that was automatically saved. This option avoids the overhead of managing
active jobs during the upgrade and is faster than explicitly stopping {dfeeds}
and closing jobs.

* {ml-docs}/stopping-ml.html[Stop all {dfeeds} and close all jobs]. This option
saves the model state at the time of closure. When you reopen the jobs after the
upgrade, they use the exact same model. However, saving the latest model state
takes longer than using upgrade mode, especially if you have a lot of jobs or
jobs with large model states.
