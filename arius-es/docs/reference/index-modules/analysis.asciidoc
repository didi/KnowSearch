== Analysis

The index analysis module acts as a configurable registry of _analyzers_
that can be used in order to convert a string field into individual terms
which are:

* added to the inverted index in order to make the document searchable
* used by high level queries such as the <<query-dsl-match-query,`match` query>>
  to generate search terms.

See <<analysis>> for configuration details.
