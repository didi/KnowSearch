== Index Shard Allocation

This module provides per-index settings to control the allocation of shards to
nodes:

* <<shard-allocation-filtering,Shard allocation filtering>>: Controlling which shards are allocated to which nodes.
* <<delayed-allocation,Delayed allocation>>: Delaying allocation of unassigned shards caused by a node leaving.
* <<allocation-total-shards,Total shards per node>>: A hard limit on the number of shards from the same index per node.
