== Configure text analysis

By default, {es} uses the <<analysis-standard-analyzer,`standard` analyzer>> for
all text analysis. The `standard` analyzer gives you out-of-the-box support for
most natural languages and use cases. If you chose to use the `standard`
analyzer as-is, no further configuration is needed.

If the standard analyzer does not fit your needs, review and test {es}'s other
built-in <<analysis-analyzers,built-in analyzers>>. Built-in analyzers don't
require configuration, but some support options that can be used to adjust their
behavior. For example, you can configure the `standard` analyzer with a list of
custom stop words to remove.

If no built-in analyzer fits your needs, you can test and create a custom
analyzer. Custom analyzers involve selecting and combining different
<<analyzer-anatomy,analyzer components>>, giving you greater control over
the process.
