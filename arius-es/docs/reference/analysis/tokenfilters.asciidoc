== Token filter reference

Token filters accept a stream of tokens from a
<<analysis-tokenizers,tokenizer>> and can modify tokens
(eg lowercasing), delete tokens (eg remove stopwords)
or add tokens (eg synonyms).

{es} has a number of built-in token filters you can use
to build <<analysis-custom-analyzer,custom analyzers>>.
