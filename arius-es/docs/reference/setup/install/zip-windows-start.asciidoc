==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat
--------------------------------------------

By default, Elasticsearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
