== Adding nodes to your cluster

When you start an instance of {es}, you are starting a _node_. An {es} _cluster_
is a group of nodes that have the same `cluster.name` attribute. As nodes join
or leave a cluster, the cluster automatically reorganizes itself to evenly
distribute the data across the available nodes.

If you are running a single instance of {es}, you have a cluster of one node.
All primary shards reside on the single node. No replica shards can be
allocated, therefore the cluster state remains yellow. The cluster is fully
functional but is at risk of data loss in the event of a failure.

You add nodes to a cluster to increase its capacity and reliability. By default,
a node is both a data node and eligible to be elected as the master node that
controls the cluster. You can also configure a new node for a specific purpose,
such as handling ingest requests. For more information, see
<<modules-node,Nodes>>.

When you add more nodes to a cluster, it automatically allocates replica shards.
When all primary and replica shards are active, the cluster state changes to
green.

To add a node to a cluster:

. Set up a new {es} instance.
. Specify the name of the cluster in its `cluster.name` attribute. For example,
to add a node to the `logging-prod` cluster, set `cluster.name: "logging-prod"`
in `elasticsearch.yml`.
. Start {es}. The node automatically discovers and joins the specified cluster.

For more information about discovery and shard allocation, see
<<modules-discovery>> and <<modules-cluster>>.
