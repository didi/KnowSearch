[[java-term-level-queries]]
=== Term level queries

While the <<java-full-text-queries,full text queries>> will analyze the query
string before executing, the _term-level queries_ operate on the exact terms
that are stored in the inverted index.

These queries are usually used for structured data like numbers, dates, and
enums, rather than full text fields.  Alternatively, they allow you to craft
low-level queries, foregoing the analysis process.

The queries in this group are:

    Find documents which contain the exact term specified in the field
    specified.

<<java-query-dsl-terms-query,`terms` query>>::

    Find documents which contain any of the exact terms specified in the field
    specified.

<<java-query-dsl-range-query,`range` query>>::

    Find documents where the field specified contains values (dates, numbers,
    or strings) in the range specified.

<<java-query-dsl-exists-query,`exists` query>>::

<<java-query-dsl-prefix-query,`prefix` query>>::
