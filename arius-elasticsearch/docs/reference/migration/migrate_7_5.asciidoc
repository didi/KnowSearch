==== Stricter checking for wildcard queries on _index
Previously, a wildcard query on the `_index` field matched directly against the
fully-qualified index name. Now, in order to match against remote indices like
`cluster:index`, the query must contain a colon, as in `cl*ster:inde*`. This
behavior aligns with the way indices are matched in the search endpoint.
