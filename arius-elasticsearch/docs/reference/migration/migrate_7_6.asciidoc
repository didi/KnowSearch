==== Deprecation of sparse vector fields
The `sparse_vector` field type has been deprecated and will be removed in 8.0.
We have not seen much interest in this experimental field type, and don't see
a clear use case as it's currently designed. If you have feedback or
suggestions around sparse vector functionality, please let us know through
GitHub or the 'discuss' forums.

[discrete]
==== Update to vector function signatures
The vector functions of the form `function(query, doc['field'])` are
deprecated, and the form `function(query, 'field')` should be used instead.
For example, `cosineSimilarity(query, doc['field'])` is replaced by
`cosineSimilarity(query, 'field')`.

==== Disallow use of the `nGram` and `edgeNGram` tokenizer names

The `nGram` and `edgeNGram` tokenizer names haven been deprecated with 7.6.
Mappings for indices created after 7.6 will continue to work but emit a
deprecation warning. The tokenizer name should be changed to the fully
equivalent `ngram` or `edge_ngram` names for new indices and in index
templates.
