=== Keep words token filter
++++
<titleabbrev>Keep words</titleabbrev>
++++

Keeps only tokens contained in a specified word list.

This filter uses Lucene's
{lucene-analysis-docs}/miscellaneous/KeepWordFilter.html[KeepWordFilter].

[NOTE]
====
To remove a list of words from a token stream, use the
<<analysis-stop-tokenfilter,`stop`>> filter.

[[analysis-keep-words-tokenfilter-analyze-ex]]
==== Example

The following <<indices-analyze,analyze API>> request uses the `keep` filter to
keep only the `fox` and `dog` tokens from
`the quick fox jumps over the lazy dog`.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _analyze
{
  "tokenizer": "whitespace",
  "filter": [
    {
      "type": "keep",
      "keep_words": [ "dog", "elephant", "fox" ]
    }
  ],
  "text": "the quick fox jumps over the lazy dog"
}
--------------------------------------------------

The filter produces the following tokens:

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------
[ fox, dog ]
--------------------------------------------------

/////////////////////
[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "tokens": [
    {
      "token": "fox",
      "start_offset": 10,
      "end_offset": 13,
      "type": "word",
      "position": 2
    },
    {
      "token": "dog",
      "start_offset": 34,
      "end_offset": 37,
      "type": "word",
      "position": 7
    }
  ]
}

[[analysis-keep-words-tokenfilter-configure-parms]]
==== Configurable parameters

`keep_words`::
+
--
(Required+++*+++, array of strings)
List of words to keep. Only tokens that match words in this list are included in
the output.

Either this parameter or `keep_words_path` must be specified.
--

`keep_words_path`::
+
--
(Required+++*+++, array of strings)
Path to a file that contains a list of words to keep. Only tokens that match
words in this list are included in the output.

This path must be absolute or relative to the `config` location, and the file
must be UTF-8 encoded. Each word in the file must be separated by a line break.

Either this parameter or `keep_words` must be specified.
--

`keep_words_case`::
(Optional, boolean)
If `true`, lowercase all keep words. Defaults to `false`.

[[analysis-keep-words-tokenfilter-customize]]
==== Customize and add to an analyzer

To customize the `keep` filter, duplicate it to create the basis for a new
custom token filter. You can modify the filter using its configurable
parameters.

For example, the following <<indices-create-index,create index API>> request
uses custom `keep` filters to configure two new
<<analysis-custom-analyzer,custom analyzers>>:

* `standard_keep_word_array`, which uses a custom `keep` filter with an inline
  array of keep words
* `standard_keep_word_file`, which uses a customer `keep` filter with a keep
  words file
