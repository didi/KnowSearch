=== Dense vector datatype

A `dense_vector` field stores dense vectors of float values.
The maximum number of dimensions that can be in a vector should
not exceed 2048. A `dense_vector` field is a single-valued field.

These vectors can be used for <<vector-functions,document scoring>>.
For example, a document score can represent a distance between
a given query vector and the indexed document vector.

You index a dense vector as an array of floats.

PUT my_index

    "properties": {
      "my_vector": {
        "type": "dense_vector",
        "dims": 3  <1>

      "my_text" : {
        "type" : "keyword"
      }

  }
}

PUT my_index/_doc/1
{
  "my_text" : "text1",
  "my_vector" : [0.5, 10, 6]
}

PUT my_index/_doc/2
{
  "my_text" : "text2",
  "my_vector" : [-0.5, 10, 10]
}

<1> dims—the number of dimensions in the vector, required parameter.

Internally, each document's dense vector is encoded as a binary
doc value. Its size in bytes is equal to
`4 * dims + 4`, where `dims`—the number of the vector's dimensions.
