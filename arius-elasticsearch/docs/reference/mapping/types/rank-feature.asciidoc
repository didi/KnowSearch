A `rank_feature` field can index numbers so that they can later be used to boost
documents in queries with a <<query-dsl-rank-feature-query,`rank_feature`>> query.

<1> Rank feature fields must use the `rank_feature` field type
<2> Rank features that correlate negatively with the score need to declare it

NOTE: `rank_feature` fields only support single-valued fields and strictly positive
values. Multi-valued fields and negative values will be rejected.

NOTE: `rank_feature` fields do not support querying, sorting or aggregating. They may
only be used within <<query-dsl-rank-feature-query,`rank_feature`>> queries.

NOTE: `rank_feature` fields only preserve 9 significant bits for the precision, which
translates to a relative error of about 0.4%.

Rank features that correlate negatively with the score should set
`positive_score_impact` to `false` (defaults to `true`). This will be used by
the <<query-dsl-rank-feature-query,`rank_feature`>> query to modify the scoring formula
in such a way that the score decreases with the value of the feature instead of
increasing. For instance in web search, the url length is a commonly used
feature which correlates negatively with scores.
