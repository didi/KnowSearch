== Indices

The indices module controls index-related settings that are globally managed
for all indices, rather than being configurable at a per-index level.

Available settings include:

<<circuit-breaker,Circuit breaker>>::

    Circuit breakers set limits on memory usage to avoid out of memory exceptions.

<<modules-fielddata,Fielddata cache>>::

    Set limits on the amount of heap used by the in-memory fielddata cache.

<<query-cache,Node query cache>>::

    Configure the amount of heap used to cache queries results.

<<indexing-buffer,Indexing buffer>>::

    Control the size of the buffer allocated to the indexing process.

<<shard-request-cache,Shard request cache>>::

    Control the behaviour of the shard-level request cache.

<<recovery,Recovery>>::

    Control the resource limits on the shard recovery process.

<<search-settings,Search Settings>>::

    Control global search settings.
