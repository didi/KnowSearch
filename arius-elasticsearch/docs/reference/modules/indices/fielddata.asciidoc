=== Fielddata

The field data cache is used mainly when sorting on or computing aggregations
on a field. It loads all the field values to memory in order to provide fast
document based access to those values. The field data cache can be
expensive to build for a field, so its recommended to have enough memory
to allocate it, and to keep it loaded.

The amount of memory used for the field
data cache can be controlled using `indices.fielddata.cache.size`. Note:
reloading  the field data which does not fit into your cache will be expensive
and  perform poorly.

`indices.fielddata.cache.size`::

    The max size of the field data cache, eg `30%` of node heap space, or an
    absolute value, eg `12GB`. Defaults to unbounded.  Also see
    <<fielddata-circuit-breaker>>.

NOTE: These are static settings which must be configured on every data node in
the cluster.

You can monitor memory usage for field data as well as the field data circuit
breaker using
