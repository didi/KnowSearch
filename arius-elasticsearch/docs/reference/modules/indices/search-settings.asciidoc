=== Search Settings

The following _expert_ setting can be set to manage global search limits.

[[indices-query-bool-max-clause-count]]
`indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`::
    Defaults to `1024`.

This setting limits the number of clauses a Lucene BooleanQuery can have. The
default of 1024 is quite high and should normally be sufficient. This limit does
not only affect Elasticsearchs `bool` query, but many other queries are rewritten to Lucene's
BooleanQuery internally. The limit is in place to prevent searches from becoming too large
and taking up too much CPU and memory. In case you're considering increasing this setting,
make sure you've exhausted all other options to avoid having to do this. Higher values can lead 
to performance degradations and memory issues, especially in clusters with a high load or 
few resources.
