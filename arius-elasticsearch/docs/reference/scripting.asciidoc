With scripting, you can evaluate custom expressions in {es}. For example, you
could use a script to return "script fields" as part of a search request or
evaluate a custom score for a query.

The default scripting language is <<modules-scripting-painless, `Painless`>>.
Additional `lang` plugins enable you to run scripts written in other languages.
Everywhere a script can be used, you can include a `lang` parameter
to specify the language of the script.
