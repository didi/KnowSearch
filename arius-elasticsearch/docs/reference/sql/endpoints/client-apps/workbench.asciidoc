==== Prerequisites

* SQL Workbench/J build 125 or higher

==== Add {es} JDBC driver

Add the {es} JDBC driver to SQL Workbench/J through *Manage Drivers* either from the main windows in the *File* menu or from the *Connect* window:

Select *Elasticsearch* profile from the left-hand side (if it is missing check the SQL Workbench/J version or add a new entry to the list through the blank page button in the upper left corner):

==== Create a new connection profile

With the driver configured, create a new connection profile through *File* > *Connect Window* (or Alt+C shortcut):

Select the previously configured driver and set the URL of your cluster using the JDBC syntax.
Verify the connection through the *Test* button - a confirmation window should appear that everything is properly configured.

The setup is complete.

==== Execute SQL queries

SQL Workbench/J is ready to talk to {es} through SQL: click on the profile created to execute statements or explore the data:
