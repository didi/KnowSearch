==== Prerequisites

* DBeaver version 6.0.0 or higher
* {es-sql} <<sql-jdbc, JDBC driver>>

==== New Connection

Create a new connection either through the menu *File* > *New* > *Database Connection* menu or directly through the *Database Connection* panel.

==== Verify the driver version

Make sure the correct JDBC driver version is used by using the *Edit Driver Settings* button:

DBeaver is aware of the {es} JDBC maven repository so simply *Download/Update* the artifact or add a new one. As an alternative one can add a local file instead if the {es} Maven repository is not an option.

When changing the driver, make sure to click on the *Find Class* button at the bottom - the Driver class should be picked out automatically however this provides a sanity check that the driver jar is properly found and it is not corrupt.

==== Test connectivity

Once the driver version and the settings are in place, use *Test Connection* to check that everything works. If things are okay, one should get a confirmation window with the version of the driver and that of {es-sql}:

Click *Finish* and the new {es} connection appears in the *Database Connection* panel.

DBeaver is now configured to talk to {es}.

==== Connect to {es}

Simply click on the {es} connection and start querying and exploring {es}:
