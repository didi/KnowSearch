Each {es} node, {ls} node, {kib} instance, and Beat is considered unique in the
cluster based on its persistent UUID, which is written to the
<<path-settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node or instance starts.

Monitoring documents are just ordinary JSON documents built by monitoring each
{stack} component at a specified collection interval. If you want to alter the
templates for these indices, see <<config-monitoring-indices>>.

{metricbeat} is used to collect monitoring data and to ship it directly to the
monitoring cluster.
