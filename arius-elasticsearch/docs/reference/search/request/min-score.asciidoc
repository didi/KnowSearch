==== min_score

Exclude documents which have a `_score` less than the minimum specified
in `min_score`:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "min_score": 0.5,
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Note, most times, this does not make much sense, but is provided for
advanced use cases.
