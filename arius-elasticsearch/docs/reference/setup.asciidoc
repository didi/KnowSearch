[[supported-platforms]]
[float]
== Supported platforms

The matrix of officially supported operating systems and JVMs is available here:
link:/support/matrix[Support Matrix]. Elasticsearch is tested on the listed
platforms, but it is possible that it will work on other platforms too.

[float]
[[jvm-version]]
== Java (JVM) Version

Elasticsearch is built using Java, and includes a bundled version of
http://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK] from the JDK maintainers (GPLv2+CE)
within each distribution. The bundled JVM is the recommended JVM and
is located within the `jdk` directory of the Elasticsearch home directory.

To use your own version of Java, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
If you must use a version of Java that is different from the bundled JVM,
we recommend using a link:/support/matrix[supported]
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html[LTS version of Java].
Elasticsearch will refuse to start if a known-bad version of Java is used.
The bundled JVM directory may be removed when using your own JVM.
