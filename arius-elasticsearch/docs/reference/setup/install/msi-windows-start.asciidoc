==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Once installed, Elasticsearch can be started from the command line, if not installed as a service
and configured to start when installation completes, as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.exe
--------------------------------------------

The command line terminal will display output similar to the following:

By default, Elasticsearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT` in addition
to the `<cluster name>.log` file within `LOGSDIRECTORY`, and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
