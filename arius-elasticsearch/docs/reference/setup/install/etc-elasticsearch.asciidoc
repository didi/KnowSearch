Elasticsearch defaults to using `/etc/elasticsearch` for runtime configuration.
The ownership of this directory and all files in this directory are set to
`root:elasticsearch` on package installation and the directory has the `setgid`
flag set so that any files and subdirectories created under `/etc/elasticsearch`
are created with this ownership as well (e.g., if a keystore is created using
the <<secure-settings,keystore tool>>). It is expected that this be maintained so
that the Elasticsearch process can read the files under this directory via the
group permissions.

Elasticsearch loads its configuration from the
`/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file by default.  The format of this
config file is explained in <<settings>>.
