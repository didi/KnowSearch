=== Install {es} on macOS with Homebrew

Elastic publishes Homebrew formulae so you can install {es} with the
https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] package manager.

To install with Homebrew, you first need to tap the
Elastic Homebrew repository:

[source,sh]
-------------------------
brew tap elastic/tap
-------------------------

Once you've tapped the Elastic Homebrew repo, you can use `brew install` to
install the default distribution of {es}:

[source,sh]
-------------------------
brew install elastic/tap/elasticsearch-full
-------------------------

This installs the most recently released default distribution of {es}.
To install the OSS distribution, specify `elastic/tap/elasticsearch-oss`.
