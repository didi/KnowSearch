Elasticsearch is as a `.tar.gz` archive for Linux and MacOS. 

include::license.asciidoc[]

The latest stable version of Elasticsearch can be found on the
link:/downloads/elasticsearch[Download Elasticsearch] page.
Other versions can be found on the
link:/downloads/past-releases[Past Releases page].

NOTE: Elasticsearch includes a bundled version of http://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK]
from the JDK maintainers (GPLv2+CE). To use your own version of Java,
see the <<jvm-version, JVM version requirements>>

The Linux archive for Elasticsearch v{version} can be downloaded and installed as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 <1>
tar -xzf elasticsearch-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-{version}/ <2>
--------------------------------------------
<1> Compares the SHA of the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive and the published checksum, which should output
    `elasticsearch-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz: OK`.
<2> This directory is known as `$ES_HOME`.

Alternatively, you can download the following package, which includes only

[[targz-configuring]]
==== Configuring Elasticsearch on the command line

Elasticsearch loads its configuration from the `$ES_HOME/config/elasticsearch.yml`
file by default.  The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.

Any settings that can be specified in the config file can also be specified on
the command line, using the `-E` syntax as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch -d -Ecluster.name=my_cluster -Enode.name=node_1
--------------------------------------------

TIP: Typically, any cluster-wide settings (like `cluster.name`) should be
added to the `elasticsearch.yml` config file, while any node-specific settings
such as `node.name` could be specified on the command line.

[[targz-layout]]
==== Directory layout of archives

The archive distributions are entirely self-contained. All files and
directories are, by default, contained within `$ES_HOME` -- the directory
created when unpacking the archive.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using Elasticsearch, and uninstalling Elasticsearch is as easy as
removing the `$ES_HOME` directory.  However, it is advisable to change the
default locations of the config directory, the data directory, and the logs
directory so that you do not delete important data later on.
