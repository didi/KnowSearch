[[cluster.name]]
=== `cluster.name`

A node can only join a cluster when it shares its `cluster.name` with all the
other nodes in the cluster. The default name is `elasticsearch`, but you should
change it to an appropriate name which describes the purpose of the cluster.

Make sure that you don't reuse the same cluster names in different environments,
otherwise you might end up with nodes joining the wrong cluster.
