[[node.name]]
=== `node.name`

Elasticsearch uses `node.name` as a human readable identifier for a
particular instance of Elasticsearch so it is included in the response
of many APIs. It defaults to the hostname that the machine has when
Elasticsearch starts but can be configured explicitly in
`elasticsearch.yml` as follows:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
node.name: prod-data-2
--------------------------------------------------
