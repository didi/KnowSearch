== Important Elasticsearch configuration

While Elasticsearch requires very little configuration, there are a number of
settings which need to be considered before going into production.

The following settings *must* be considered before going to production:

* <<path-settings,Path settings>>
* <<cluster.name,Cluster name>>
* <<node.name,Node name>>
* <<network.host,Network host>>
* <<discovery-settings,Discovery settings>>
* <<heap-size,Heap size>>
* <<heap-dump-path,Heap dump path>>
* <<gc-logging,GC logging>>
* <<es-tmpdir,Temp directory>>
