== Geo queries

Elasticsearch supports two types of geo data:
<<geo-point,`geo_point`>> fields which support lat/lon pairs, and
<<geo-shape,`geo_shape`>> fields, which support points,
lines, circles, polygons, multi-polygons, etc.

The queries in this group are:

<<query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query,`geo_bounding_box`>> query::
Finds documents with geo-points that fall into the specified rectangle.

<<query-dsl-geo-distance-query,`geo_distance`>> query::
Finds documents with geo-points within the specified distance of a central point.

<<query-dsl-geo-polygon-query,`geo_polygon`>> query::
Find documents with geo-points within the specified polygon.

<<query-dsl-geo-shape-query,`geo_shape`>> query::
Finds documents with geo-shapes which either intersect, are contained by, or do not intersect with the specified
geo-shape.
