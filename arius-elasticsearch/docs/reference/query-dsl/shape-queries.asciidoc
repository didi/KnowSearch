== Shape queries

Like <<geo-shape,`geo_shape`>> Elasticsearch supports the ability to index
arbitrary two dimension (non Geospatial) geometries making it possible to
map out virtual worlds, sporting venues, theme parks, and CAD diagrams. The
<<shape,`shape`>> field type supports points, lines, polygons, multi-polygons,
envelope, etc.

The queries in this group are:

<<query-dsl-shape-query,`shape`>> query::
Finds documents with shapes that either intersect, are within, or do not
intersect a specified shape.
