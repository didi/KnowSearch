[[ml-open-job-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

An {anomaly-job} must be opened in order for it to be ready to receive and
analyze data. It can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its
lifecycle.

When you open a new job, it starts with an empty model.

When you open an existing job, the most recent model state is automatically
loaded. The job is ready to resume its analysis from where it left off, once new
data is received.
