You do not need to configure any settings to use {transforms}. It is enabled by default.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. 
The dynamic settings can also be updated across a cluster with the 
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings API>>.

TIP: Dynamic settings take precedence over settings in the `elasticsearch.yml` 
file.

==== General {transforms} settings

`xpack.transform.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {transforms} on the node. +
+
If set to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`, the {transform} APIs are disabled on the node.
Therefore the node cannot start or administrate {transform} or receive transport (internal)
communication requests related to {transform} APIs.
+
IMPORTANT: If you want to use {transform} features in your cluster, you must have
`xpack.transform.enabled` set to `true` on all master-eligible nodes. This is the
default behavior.

`xpack.transform.num_transform_failure_retries` (<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>)::
The number of times that a {transform} retries when it experiences a
non-fatal error. Once the number of retries is exhausted, the {transform}
task will be marked as `failed`. The default value is `10` with a valid minimum of `0`
and maximum of `100`.
If a {transform} is already running, it will have to be restarted
to use the changed setting.
