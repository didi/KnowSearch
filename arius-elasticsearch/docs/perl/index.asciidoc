== Synopsis

[source,perl]
------------------------------------
use Search::Elasticsearch;

# Connect to localhost:9200:
my $e = Search::Elasticsearch->new();

# Round-robin between two nodes:
my $e = Search::Elasticsearch->new(
    nodes => [
        'search1:9200',
        'search2:9200'
    ]
);

# Connect to cluster at search1:9200, sniff all nodes and round-robin between them:
my $e = Search::Elasticsearch->new(
    nodes    => 'search1:9200',
    cxn_pool => 'Sniff'
);

# Index a document:
$e->index(
    index   => 'my_app',
    type    => 'blog_post',
    id      => 1,
    body    => {
        title   => 'Elasticsearch clients',
        content => 'Interesting content...',
        date    => '2014-09-24'
    }
);

# Get the document:
my $doc = $e->get(
    index   => 'my_app',
    type    => 'blog_post',
    id      => 1
);

# Search:
my $results = $e->search(
    index => 'my_app',
    body  => {
        query => {
            match => { title => 'elasticsearch' }
        }
    }
);
------------------------------------

[[v0_90]]
== Elasticsearch 0.90.* and earlier

The current version of the client supports the Elasticsearch 1.0 branch by
default, which is not backwards compatible with the 0.90 branch.

If you need to talk to a version of Elasticsearch before 1.0.0,
please use `Search::Elasticsearch::Client::0_90::Direct` as follows:

[source,perl]
------------------------------------
    $es = Search::Elasticsearch->new(
        client => '0_90::Direct'
    );
------------------------------------
