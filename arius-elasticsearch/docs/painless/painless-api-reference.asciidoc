== Painless API Reference

Painless has a strict whitelist for methods and classes per context to
ensure all painless scripts are secure. Most of these methods are
exposed directly from the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) while others
are part of Elasticsearch or Painless itself. Below is a list of the available
APIs per context. The shared API is available to all contexts, while the
specialized API available differs between contexts.
