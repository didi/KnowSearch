=== Get Pipeline API

[[java-rest-high-ingest-get-pipeline-request]]
==== Get Pipeline Request

A `GetPipelineRequest` requires one or more `pipelineIds` to fetch.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[get-pipeline-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The pipeline id to fetch

==== Optional arguments
The following arguments can optionally be provided:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[get-pipeline-request-masterTimeout]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `TimeValue`
<2> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `String`

[[java-rest-high-ingest-get-pipeline-sync]]
==== Synchronous Execution

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[get-pipeline-execute]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Execute the request and get back the response in a GetPipelineResponse object.

[[java-rest-high-ingest-get-pipeline-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous execution of a get pipeline request requires both the `GetPipelineRequest`
instance and an `ActionListener` instance to be passed to the asynchronous
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[get-pipeline-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `GetPipelineRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `GetPipelineResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[get-pipeline-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[[java-rest-high-ingest-get-pipeline-response]]
==== Get Pipeline Response

The returned `GetPipelineResponse` allows to retrieve information about the executed
 operation as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[get-pipeline-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Check if a matching pipeline id was found or not.
<2> Get the list of pipelines found as a list of `PipelineConfig` objects.
<3> Get the individual configuration of each pipeline as a `Map<String, Object>`.
