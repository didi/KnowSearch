=== Find File Structure API

The Find File Structure API can be used to find the structure of a text file
and other information that will be useful to import its contents to an {es}
index.  It accepts a +{request}+ object and responds
with a +{response}+ object.

==== Find File Structure Request

A sample from the beginning of the file (or the entire file contents if
it's small) must be added to the +{request}+ object using the
`FindFileStructureRequest#setSample` method.
