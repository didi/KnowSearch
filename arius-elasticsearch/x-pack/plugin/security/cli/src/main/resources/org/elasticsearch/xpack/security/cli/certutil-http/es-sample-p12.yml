#
# This is a sample configuration snippet for Elasticsearch that enables and configures SSL for the HTTP (Rest) interface
#
# This was automatically generated at: ${DATE} ${TIME}
# This configuration was intended for Elasticsearch version ${VERSION}
#
# You should review these settings, and then update the main configuration file at
#   ${CONF_DIR}/elasticsearch.yml
#

# This turns on SSL for the HTTP (Rest) interface
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true

# This configures the keystore to use for SSL on HTTP
#if PASSWORD
# Because your keystore has a password, you will also need to add the password to the Elasticsearch keystore
#    elasticsearch-keystore add "xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.secure_password"
#endif
xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: "${P12}"
