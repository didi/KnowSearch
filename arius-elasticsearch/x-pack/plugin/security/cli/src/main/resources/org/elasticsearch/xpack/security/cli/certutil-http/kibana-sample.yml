# SAMPLE KIBANA CONFIGURATION FOR ENABLING SSL TO ELASTICSEARCH
#
# This is a sample configuration snippet for Kibana that configures SSL for connections to Elasticsearch
#
# This was automatically generated at: ${DATE} ${TIME}
# This configuration was intended for version ${VERSION}
#
# You should review these settings, and then update the main kibana.yml configuration file.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  You also need to update the URLs in your "elasticsearch.hosts" setting to use the "https" URL.
#  e.g. If your kibana.yml file currently has
#
#  elasticsearch.hosts: [ "http://localhost:9200" ]
#
#  then you should change this to:
#
#  elasticsearch.hosts: [ "https://localhost:9200" ]
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This configures Kibana to trust a specific Certificate Authority for connections to Elasticsearch
elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: [ "config/${CA_CERT_NAME}" ]
